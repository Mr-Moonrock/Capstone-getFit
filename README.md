## Concerns and Issues
Encountered issues include the dropping of exercises on the calendar requiring multiple attempts to register, and challenges with testing Exercise/Cardio Carousels. Unfortunately, the FullCalendar docs doesn't do a great job explaining this particular scenario, nor is there much information on YouTube or online. 
## 
Other issues I had was with testing the Exercise/Cardio Carousels. I was having trouble detecting when the certain imgs were 'active' was 'true or false'. I tried mocking timers, and using fireEvents on the buttons, but neither approach was working properly.

For the backend testing, I ran into problems with registering a 404 error with the missing userId, and also ensuring that the 2nd pool.query for the 'INSERT' was being called on the forms. The test would come back as a (200), however the format of the INSERT query continually failed the test.
